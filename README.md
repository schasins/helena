# Helena Web Automation and Web Scraping

#### What is Helena?
Helena is a Chrome extension that can help automate repetitive interactions with well-structured webpages.  A user can demonstrate how to scrape the first row of a dataset, and Helena will write a program for scraping the next hundreds or thousands of rows.  Helena is also the name of the web automation language that the Helena extension uses.  See <a href="http://helena-lang.org/" target="_blank">http://helena-lang.org/</a> for an overview of the Helena project.

#### Can I see Helena in action?
Sure!  Here's a very quick video demo:

#### Can I use Helena if I don't know how to code?
Yes!  In fact Helena is designed especially for non-programmers.  The idea is that you provide a demonstration of the actions you want Helena to do, and Helena figures out the rest.

#### How should I learn to use Helena?
We recommend learning from video tutorials!  Our current playlist of tutorials is available here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYeneIW6KQxIDUEp2QaNNKrgXg9hVvxZo

We recommend starting with something simple like our favorite Google Scholar example!

Once you've watched a few video tutorials and you're almost ready to start writing your own scripts, we highly recommend checking out our tips and tricks page: https://github.com/schasins/helena/wiki/Helena-Tips-and-Tricks.

#### Is Helena reliable?
Helena is just a research prototype.  It's being developed by only one person, and it's still quite new.  So definitely don't expect it to be a reliable, professional-quality, production-ready tool.  But if you run into problems, please get in touch - we want to keep making it better!

#### May I use Helena for my project?
We designed Helena to help researchers, especially social scientists and data scientists.  If you're looking to use Helena for those purposes, please go ahead!

#### Are you looking for collaborators?
Yes!  If you're interested in either using Helena for your research or in helping to improve Helena, please get in touch!

          <p>
          Helena is a research prototype!
          This means we don't have accounts, passwords, all that jazz.
          We're not trying to collect personal info.
          We provide the tool so that folks can try out the techniques described in our research papers.
          </p>

          
          <p>
          We collect two kinds of data in Helena: 
          First, when you click the "Save and Run Script" button, we save the script you've written.
          Second, when you run a Helena script that includes data recording, we save the data.
          (The data saved from a run can then be downloaded by clicking the "Download Data" buttons.)
          </p>

<a id="resources" href="/resources">&larr; Resources</a>

<script>
$("#resources").button();
